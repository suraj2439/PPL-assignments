1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? 
Why do some variables have a suffix `(D)'?

Ans - Usage of local variable as an operand uses a unique number suffexed with local variable. 
Some variable have suffix (D) which indicate that variable is used directly(unintialized) without assignment(implicit assignment in the declaration).


2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments to variable `a'  and `b' merge. 
You will notice  that PHI statements have  been  introduced.  
Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI statements?

Ans - PHI merges assignments of different paths and creates a new assignent. In given example # b_2 = PHI <b_8(3), b_6(4)> means if program reaches after complition of basic block 3 then value is b_8, else if program reaches after basic block 4 then value will be b_6.


3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two versions of a variable ?
Ans- 
	int main() {
		int a = 0, b = 0;
		if(b > 1)
			a = 2;
		else if(b == 3)
			a = 4;
		else
			a = 5;
		b = a;
		return 0;
	}

also PHI node merges i more than two versions in switch case also.

	int main() {
		int x, y = 0;
		switch(x) {
			case(0) : 
				x = 1;
			case(1) :
				x = 2;
			case(2) : 
				x = 3;
			default :
				x = 4;
		}

	y = x;
	return 0;
	}
