1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original code (as seen in the SSA pass)? 
What about after the FRE pass?

ANS -  In the SSA pass it is calculated twice. But in the FRE pass it is calculated only once.

       
2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you check?

Ans - The   file  B-4.c.*.optimized. This  is  the   last  GIMPLE intra-procedural pass.
If it is same as the output of FRE, then no more optimizations have occured.
