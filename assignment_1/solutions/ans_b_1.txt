1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). 
Then why is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

Ans - This is because other files may include this function by header file of this file in that time this function will also be property of other file.


2   Is there any way to get rid of it?

Ans - Declaration of function which limits contents of this file within itself may remove defination of this function later.
like a declaration by 'static' keyword which restrict the function within itself.
