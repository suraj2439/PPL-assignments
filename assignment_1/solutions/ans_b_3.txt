1   In the file B-3.c, what values  can variable `a' take? 
Will the `if' condition [a  < 4] ever  be true?  Inspect the file  B-3.c.*.vrp1 to analyze the dump.

ANS -  As the variable 'a' takes values from 4 to 99 then the condition a<4 will never be true. 
So, the code in that block will be eliminated.
